# Get Fit Together x VYAIAM Clinic: Your 8-Week

# Participant Guide

## 1.0 Introduction: The "Get Fit Together" Philosophy

Welcome to your official playbook for the next eight weeks. This isn't just a guide; it's the
foundation for a period of focused effort, community-driven accountability, and
sustainable habit formation. This document outlines everything you need to know to
succeed in the Get Fit Together x VYAIAM Clinic programme. We'll start by defining our
core philosophy, making it crystal clear why our unique approach to fitness delivers
measurable, lasting results.

**Programme at a Glance**

- **Programme Name:** Get Fit Together X VYAIAM Clinic
- **Format:** Group-based fitness challenge + gamified habit-building programme
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Programme Lead:** Dr. Atharva Dole (VYAIAM Clinic)

**Our Core Mission**

This programme is engineered for one thing: tangible outcomes. By the end of our 8
weeks together, our mission is for you to have achieved the following:

1. **Build sustainable habits** that you can maintain long after the programme ends.
2. **Improve your strength and fitness** through consistent daily strength training.
3. **Upgrade your fundamentals** by mastering clean eating, hydration, daily
    movement, and sleep.
4. **Create powerful accountability** through daily check-ins and active community
    participation.
5. **Track real, measurable progress** in weight, body composition (where available),
    and, most importantly, behavioral consistency.

**What Makes This Programme Different**

We are not a quick fix. Our approach is built on a specific ethos that fosters resilience
and real change. This is our code:

- **No shame. No guilt. No “all or nothing.”** A missed workout or a bad meal is a
    data point, not a disaster. Log it, learn, and get back on track.


- **Honesty wins. This runs on an honor system.** The goal is to build a better
    version of yourself, not to game a leaderboard.
- **We compete—but we also pull each other up.** We use friendly competition to
    bring out our best, but we are a team first.
- **Small wins count. Showing up for 30 minutes matters.** We reward the act of
    showing up, especially on the days you don't feel like it.

This guide will now help you determine if our philosophy and structure are the right fit
for your personal goals.

## 2.0 Is This Programme Right for You?

**A Critical Note on Health & Safety**

Your well-being is our top priority. If you have any pre-existing injuries, are managing
medical conditions, or are under a clinician's supervision, it is imperative that you
follow their guidance and utilize appropriate modifications for all activities. When in
doubt about any exercise or requirement, consult directly with Atharva.

Now that you've confirmed this is the right path for you, let's break down the daily habits
that will pave that path.

## 3.0 The Six Pillars: Your Daily Path to Consistency

To understand this programme, you must understand its three interconnected layers: 1)
**Daily Habits** (the foundational pillars), 2) **Training Progression** (the daily strength
WODs), and 3) **Community + Competition** (the leaderboards and events). These layers


run together to create the full experience. This section focuses on the most critical
layer: the daily habits, or "pillars." These six actions are the non-negotiable building
blocks of your journey. Your success, and your score, comes from mastering them.

**3.1 Pillar A: Workout (Strength Training)**

**Daily Goal: ~30 minutes of strength training or an approved equivalent.**

This pillar is designed to build functional strength and improve your overall fitness. You
can achieve this daily goal by performing Atharva's provided Workout of the Day (WOD)
or by completing your own structured strength training routine. Acceptable forms
include bodyweight sessions, resistance training, and other approved equivalents for
special circumstances (e.g., rehab-focused sessions), which must be clarified with
Atharva.

**Strong suggestion:** If you’re unsure, default to Atharva’s plan. The biggest results come
from following a consistent structure.

**3.2 Pillar B: Nutrition (Clean Eating)**

**Daily Goal: Focus on repeatable clean-eating behaviours.**

This programme does not require perfection. It rewards repeatable behaviours that
build momentum. Points are awarded for consistently incorporating these simple, high-
impact nutritional choices into your day:

- Home-cooked meals
- Vegetables/salad in at least two meals
- Two fruits a day
- A high-quality protein meal

**3.3 Pillar C: Hydration**

**Daily Goal: ≥ 2.5 litres/day.**

Proper hydration is critical for performance, recovery, and overall health. This pillar is
straightforward: if you meet the daily minimum, you score the points. Aim to space your
water intake throughout the day.

**3.4 Pillar D: Conscious Sleep**

**Daily Goal: ≥ 7 hours/night.**

Sleep is a powerful performance enhancer that directly impacts your recovery, mood,
discipline, and food cravings. Prioritizing at least seven hours of quality sleep is a non-
negotiable part of this programme.


**3.5 Pillar E: Activity / Steps**

**Daily Goal: ≥ 5,000 steps/day.**

This pillar establishes a minimum baseline for daily movement, ensuring you remain
active even on rest days or during busy periods. It’s about building the habit of
consistent, low-intensity activity.

**3.6 Pillar F: Personal Wellness Goals**

**Daily Goal: Complete your two self-selected personal goals.**

Each participant will choose two personal, measurable, and daily wellness goals. This
allows you to customize the programme to support your individual growth beyond
fitness. Examples include:

- 10 minutes of reading
- Journaling
- Meditation or breathwork
- 10 minutes of mobility work or stretching
- Digital detox after 10 PM
- A morning sunlight walk
- Meal or protein preparation

Now that you understand the pillars, let's look at how completing them translates into
points on the scoreboard.

## 4.0 The Gamification System: How to Earn Points and Win

This isn't just about working out; it's about winning the day. Our gamified point system is
the scoreboard for your consistency. It’s designed to fuel your competitive fire and
reward the discipline you bring every single day. Memorize this section—this is how you
win.

**4.1 Daily Points Breakdown**

The majority of your score comes from completing the six daily pillars. The table below
outlines the points available each day.

```
Habit/Action Points

```
```
Notes
```
**Base Points** (^)


```
Workout Completed +20 Strength training or approved

Personal Goal 2 Completed +5 Your self-selected daily goal
**Maximum Possible Daily Score: 70 points** (before any negative points are applied).
Base: 50 + Nutrition: 10 + Personal goals: 10 = Daily total possible: 70
**4.2 Negative Points**
To encourage mindful choices, certain actions will result in a point deduction. Honesty
in logging these is a cornerstone of the programme's integrity.
**Action Points Deducted**
Junk/fried food – 5
Processed sugar – 5
More than 2 alcoholic drinks in one session – 5
**Clarification on Alcohol Rules:**

- You are permitted up to three alcohol consumption sessions per week.
- If a session involves **more than two drinks** , you must log a –5 point penalty for
    that session.


- If you consume two or fewer drinks in a session, there is no penalty.

**4.3 Streak Bonuses: Rewarding Momentum**

Streaks are designed to reward your momentum and encourage you to stay on track.
The system automatically awards bonus points when you hit key milestones for
consecutive days of action.

```
Streak Type Milestone Bonus Points
```
```
Check-in Streak (any daily log) 3 - day streak +
```
```
7 - day streak^ +^

Clean Eating Streak (no junk/processed sugar) 3 - day clean streak +
```
```
7 - day clean streak^ +^
```
```
14 - day clean streak^ +^
```
**4.4 Weekly Admin Points: Recognizing Intangible Effort**

Each week, Atharva will award up to 30 additional "dynamic points" to each participant.
These points recognize qualitative factors that are crucial for success but aren't
captured in daily checkboxes. Points are awarded across three categories (0-10 points
each):

- **Consistency & discipline:** Acknowledges regular check-ins and minimal missed
    days.
- **Effort & intensity:** Recognizes visible effort, form improvement, and safely
    pushing your limits.
- **Community participation:** Rewards supporting squad mates, showing up, and
    motivating others.

**4.5 Bi-Weekly Community Events**


Every two weeks, the entire group will participate in a community event, such as a trek,
group sport, or long walk. These events are designed to build camaraderie and
strengthen accountability.

- **Attendance Reward:** Participants who attend the event earn **+20 points**.
- **Leader's Choice:** The participant with the highest point total from the preceding
    two-week period earns the right to choose the next community activity.
- **Alternate Activity:** For those who genuinely cannot attend, a comparable
    activity can be completed over the weekend to earn the points.

With the rules of the game clear, let's review the 8-week timeline and what to expect at
each stage.

## 5.0 The 8-Week Journey: A Phased Roadmap

This is your strategic timeline. We've broken the 8-week journey into distinct phases,
each with a specific focus. This structure is designed to help you manage your efforts,
build momentum effectively, and finish stronger than you started.

**Programme Phases**

- **Week 0 (Onboarding / Setup):** Your foundational week. The focus is on
    completing your registration, recording baseline metrics, being assigned to your
    squad, and ensuring you have total clarity on the programme rules.
- **Weeks 1–2 (Foundation):** The habit-building phase. The primary goals are to lock
    in the discipline of daily check-ins, build workout consistency, and master the
    basics of clean eating.
- **Weeks 3–4 (Momentum):** This is where your consistency pays off. You'll focus
    on building stronger streaks, improving the quality of your food choices, and
    increasing the intensity of your workouts.
- **Weeks 5–6 (Intensity + Discipline):** In this phase, you'll work on minimizing slip-
    ups and refining your habits, with a special focus on achieving greater
    consistency with your sleep and hydration goals.
- **Weeks 7–8 (Finish Strong):** The final push. The focus is on sustaining your hard-
    earned habits, avoiding burnout, celebrating your progress, and participating in
    the final community event to wrap up the journey.

**Progress Checkpoints**

To ensure you can see your progress and make adjustments, we recommend the
following review schedule:


- **Baseline (Day 1):** Record your starting weight, photos (optional), measurements
    (optional), and muscle/body fat percentages if available.
- **Every 2 weeks:** Conduct a quick progress review focusing on changes in weight
    and your overall habit consistency.
- **Week 8 end:** Record your final numbers, reflect on your journey, celebrate the
    winners, and discuss your next steps.

This roadmap provides the "what" and "when." The next section covers the "how" of
getting started.

## 6.0 Onboarding: Your Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Started

This section is your practical, actionable checklist for a successful start. Following
these steps carefully is the first key to a smooth and effective onboarding experience.
Complete each item to ensure you are fully integrated into the programme systems.

1. **Step 1: Register on the Web App** Use the official registration link:
    https://getfittogether.vercel.app/. You must use the following email format to
    create your account: your-first-name-and-last-name-initial@gft.com (for
    example, mihirb@gft.com). Set your own password; no external authentication is
    needed.
2. **Step 2: Select Your Squad** Upon registration, you will be prompted to select a
    squad. Atharva will communicate your specific squad assignment to you during
    the onboarding process.
3. **Step 3: Fill Your Baseline Details** You will need to enter your starting weight,
    height, muscle percentage, and body fat percentage. If you do not have access to
    accurate muscle and body fat numbers, please use the following placeholder
    values for now and update them later: Muscle %: 35, Body fat %: 25.
4. **Step 4: Access Your Dashboard** Once Atharva approves your registration, you
    will gain access to your personal dashboard. Here you will find your 8-week
    journey map, the daily workout (WOD), and the portal for your daily check-ins.
5. **Step 5: Join the WhatsApp Group** The official programme WhatsApp group is
    our primary communication channel. It will be used for daily announcements,
    WOD reminders, community event planning, and, most importantly, daily
    motivation and accountability.

**Essential Tools: App & Google Sheet**

We use two systems to ensure a smooth experience and secure data. The **web app**
provides the primary user experience (dashboard, WOD, check-ins), while a **Google
Sheet** serves as the official backup ledger to ensure no data is ever lost.


It is a **non-negotiable** requirement to log your habits daily, preferably by the end of each
day. If you forget to log in the app, you have a 24-hour fail-safe window to update your
personal row in the Google Sheet. After 24 hours, the day will be marked as "missed" for
streak calculation purposes to maintain fairness.

With your setup complete, it's time to understand the code of conduct that makes our
community thrive.

## 7.0 Rules of Engagement: Our Code of Conduct

Our programme's success is built on a foundation of community, accountability, and
fair play. While individual effort is crucial, our collective progress depends on the
supportive and respectful environment we create together. These principles govern our
interactions and ensure a positive experience for everyone.

**The Honor System is Our Backbone**

This entire programme operates on trust. The point system is a tool to motivate and
measure progress, but its integrity relies on honest, accurate self-reporting. The
ultimate goal is not simply to "win points," but to build a more consistent and
disciplined version of yourself.

**Our Non-Negotiable Community Rules**

To protect our culture of support and psychological safety, the following rules are not up
for debate:

- No body shaming. No mocking.
- No toxic competitiveness.
- Support > sarcasm.
- Respect privacy: don’t forward screenshots outside the group without
    permission.
- Celebrate effort: especially when someone is struggling.

**Participant Commitments**

As a member of this squad, you commit to:

- Completing daily check-ins honestly and consistently.
- Keeping all competition healthy and supportive.
- Attempting the daily WOD or an equivalent strength training session.
- Showing up for community events whenever possible.
- Supporting your squad mates, especially when they have a setback.


**Atharva’s Responsibilities**

As the Programme Lead, Atharva is responsible for:

- Uploading daily strength workouts (WOD).
- Setting the weekly rhythm with themes, reminders, and guidance.
- Awarding weekly admin/dynamic points fairly and transparently.
- Maintaining group morale and programme discipline.
- Resolving any disputes and providing clarity on the rules.

**Rewards, Recognition, and Light Punishments**

To keep the journey engaging and fun, we will incorporate a system of rewards and light-
hearted consequences.

- **Recommended Recognition Layers**
    o Weekly shout-outs for the most consistent participant, biggest
       comeback, and best community supporter.
    o The bi-weekly points leader gets to choose the next community event.
    o Final awards for the overall points champion, most consistent streak, and
       best habit transformation.
- **Reward Ideas**
    o Winners receive a group-paid meal or treat.
    o A small trophy or medal.
    o A sponsored sports item (e.g., cap, water bottle).
    o The winner chooses the next group outing.
- **Light Punishment Ideas**
    o The last-place participant brings healthy snacks to the next event.
    o The last-place participant makes a "thank-you post" appreciating the
       squad.
    o The last-place participant funds a small group coffee.
    o The last-place participant organizes the logistics for the next community
       event.

**Golden Rule:** Punishments must **never** be shaming, dangerous, expensive, or personal.


This code of conduct ensures we build a positive environment. To clarify any final
details, please review the FAQ below.

## 8.0 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This section contains answers to the most common questions participants may have
about the programme's rules, logistics, and expectations.

1. **Do I have to do Atharva’s WOD every day?** No. You can do Atharva’s WOD or
    your own ~30-minute strength training session. WOD is recommended for
    structure.
2. **What if I miss a workout due to travel or a hectic day?** Don’t quit the
    programme. Missed days happen. Log honestly, then get back on track the next
    day.
3. **What if I have an injury?** Do a modified session or rehab-focused workout.
    Inform Atharva if you need help adjusting.
4. **Is this a weight loss programme?** It can lead to fat loss, but the real focus is
    habits + strength + consistency.
5. **I can’t measure muscle % or body fat %. What should I do?** Use placeholder
    values for now (e.g., muscle 35, body fat 25) and update later when you can
    measure.
6. **What counts as “processed sugar”?** Common examples: sweets, desserts,
    sugary drinks, packaged sugary snacks. If unsure, use common sense and be
    consistent.
7. **What counts as “junk/fried food”?** Deep-fried items, fast food, heavily
    oily/snack foods. Again: be honest and consistent.
8. **If I had junk food once, should I stop logging to avoid negative points?** No.
    Logging is the whole point. One slip logged honestly is better than pretending.
9. **Alcohol sessions allowed—what does that mean?** You can have up to 3
    sessions/week. If you go beyond 2 drinks in any session, you get –5 for that
    session.
10. **What if I forget to check in on the app?** Use the Google Sheet fail-safe. Update
    within 24 hours to protect streak fairness.
11. **Do I need to share photos or body measurements?** Not required unless the
    group decides so. Progress can be tracked with numbers and consistency.


12. **Can I do additional workouts?** Yes, but points are designed around the
    programme pillars. Extra workouts are encouraged for fitness, not for “farming
    points.”
13. **How are weekly admin points decided?** Atharva awards them based on
    consistency, effort, and community participation. The goal is fairness and
    motivation.
14. **What if someone is obviously cheating?** The programme is built on trust. If
    there’s a serious issue, raise it respectfully with Atharva.
15. **What’s the best way to “win” this programme?** Show up daily. Log honestly.
    Help others. Build streaks. Attend events. Sleep well. Repeat.

## 9.0 A Final Word: Let the Journey Begin

The Get Fit Together X VYAIAM Clinic programme is built on a simple yet powerful

building discipline, celebrating small wins, and supporting each other through every
step.

Let’s compete hard, but let’s also commit to ensuring that every single person finishes
these 8 weeks stronger, fitter, and proud of the habits they have built.
